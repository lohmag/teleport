title: Machine ID with Application Access
description: Accessing web applications with Machine ID
---

In this guide, we will demonstrate how to use Machine ID to access a web
application protected by Teleport from an automated service.

With Machine ID, Teleport issues short-lived certificates, tied to a machine
identity, that can be rotated, audited, and managed with the same access
controls that Teleport provides for human users.

## Prerequisites

<ScopedBlock scope={["cloud"]}>
You will need Teleport Cloud 10.1.0 or later.
</ScopedBlock>
<ScopedBlock scope={["oss","enterprise"]}>
You will need to be running the Teleport Proxy and Auth Services, version 10.1.0
or later.
</ScopedBlock>

If you have not already connected your application to Teleport, follow
the [Application Access Getting Started Guide](../application-access/getting-started.mdx).

If you're not already familiar with Machine ID, follow the
[Getting Started Guide](../getting-started.mdx) to familiarize yourself with
Machine ID. You'll also need `tctl` access to initially configure the bot.

(!docs/pages/includes/tctl.mdx!)

Lastly, ensure both `tbot` is installed on your Machine ID client system. Refer
to our [Installation guide](../../installation.mdx) for more information.

## Step 1/3. Create a Machine ID bot and assign permissions

## Step 2/3. Configure and start Machine ID

## Step 3/3. Connect to your web application with the Machine ID identity
