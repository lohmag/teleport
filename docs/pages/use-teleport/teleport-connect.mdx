Teleport Connect provides easy and secure access to SSH servers and databases, with support for
other resources such as Kubernetes clusters and applications coming in the future.

## Installation & upgrade

Head over to the [Downloads](https://goteleport.com/download/) page to download the most recent
version of Teleport Connect. As of now, Teleport Connect supports macOS only. Double-click the
downloaded `.dmg` file and drag the Teleport Connect icon to the Applications folder.

To upgrade Teleport Connect to a newer version, drag the new version to the Applications folder.

## User interface

![user interface of Teleport Connect](../../img/use-teleport/connect-ui-overview.png)

The top bar of Teleport Connect consists of:

- The **profile selector** (the top right), which allows you to switch between profiles on different Teleport
  clusters as well as log in or out of the clusters.
- The **connection list** (the top left) showing recent connections, allowing you to seamlessly switch
  between them.
- The **command bar** (in the middle), which launches any command you input in a new terminal tab.
- The **cluster selector** (to the left of the command bar), which shows up only if you have set up Trusted Clusters and there are leaf clusters
  connected to the root cluster. It lets you browse leaf cluster resources. It also changes
  which cluster the commands in the command bar are going to target.

## Connecting to an SSH server

1. Open a tab with cluster resources by clicking on the plus symbol at the right end of the tab bar.
   You can also press `Cmd + T` to achieve the same result.
2. Look for the SSH server you want to connect to and click the Connect button to the right.
3. Select or enter the SSH user you wish to log in as and press `Enter`.
4. A new tab will open with a shell session on the chosen server.

Alternatively, you can type `tsh ssh` into the command bar and the autocompletion will help you
connect to a server.

## Connecting to a database

1. Open a tab with cluster resources by clicking on the plus symbol at the end of the tab bar. You
   can also press `Cmd + T` to achieve the same result.
2. Select the Databases section.
3. Look for the database server you wish to connect to and click the Connect button to the right.
4. Select or enter the database user you with to use and press `Enter`.
5. A new tab will open with a new connection established between your device and the database
   server.

This connection will remain active until you click the Close Connection button or close Teleport
Connect. The port number will persist between app restartsâ€”you can set up your favorite client
without worrying about the port suddenly changing.

### With a GUI client

To connect with a GUI client, follow the instructions in the database connection tab under the
Connect with GUI section.

### With a CLI client

The database connection tab shows the command that can be used to connect to the database. You can
modify the database name of the connection and then click the Run button to open a new
terminal tab with that command executed.

## Connecting to multiple clusters

Teleport Connect allows you to log in to multiple clusters at the same time. After logging in to
your first cluster, open the profile selector at the top right and click the *+Add another cluster*
button. You can switch between active profiles in multiple ways:

- Click at the profile selector button at the top right.
- Open the profile selector with a shortcut (`Cmd + I`).
- Using the connection list at the top left to select a connection will automatically switch you to
  the right profile.

At the moment Teleport Connect supports only one user per cluster. To log in as a different user,
log out of the cluster first.

## Restarting and reconnecting

Before closing, Teleport Connect will remember the tabs that you had open at the end of the session.
Next time you open the app, Connect will ask you if you want to reopen those tabs. If you agree,
Connect will restore connections to all resources that were active before you closed the app.

When restoring terminal tabs, Teleport Connect doesn't attempt to re-execute commands that were in
progress when the app was closed. It will only restore the working directory for those tabs.

## Troubleshooting

Logging out of a cluster, closing the app and logging in again resets all app state related to that
cluster. This can help if you encounter a bug which renders the user interface partially unusable.
It might also help if you have issues with connecting to an active cluster that don't happen in the
Web UI.

To force the app to log you out of all clusters, close the app and remove the `~/Library/Application
Support/Teleport Connect/tsh` folder. Removing the file under `~/Library/Application
Support/Teleport Connect/app_state.json` will clear all remembered tabs and connections.

### Submitting an issue

To submit an issue, click the Submit Feedback button at the bottom right (the speech bubble symbol)
and follow the *Submit a Bug* link.

Be sure to attach logs which can be found under `~/Library/Application Support/Teleport
Connect/logs`. The version of the app can be found in the app menu under the About Teleport Connect
menu item.

### Updating local shell environment

Teleport Connect updates and caches the local shell environment on app restart and not when starting
a new shell session. If you add new environment variables to your shell startup files, Connect will
see them only after you restart the app.
