h1: Teleport Email Plugin Setup

This guide will talk through how to setup Teleport with Email notification for Access Requests.


## Setup

### Prerequisites

This guide assumes that you have:

- A running Teleport Cluster
- Admin privileges with access to `tctl`
- Mailgun or SMTP credentials

Teleport Cloud requires connecting through the proxy service (`mytenant.teleport.sh:443`).
If you want the Email plugin to connect through the web port (`teleport.example.com:443`) follow the Teleport Cloud instructions.
OpenSource and Enterprise installations can connect to the auth service (`auth.example.com:3025`) directly.

#### Create user and role for access

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="OpenSource, Enterprise" scope={["oss","enterprise"]}>
Log into Teleport Authentication Server, this is where you normally run `tctl`. Create a
new user and role that only has API access to the `access_request` API. The below script
will create a yaml resource file for a new user and role.
</TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Cloud" scope={["cloud"]}>

Teleport Cloud requires authenticating with a role that has [`impersonation`](https://goteleport.com/docs/access-controls/guides/impersonation/) rights and can create the `access-plugin` role and user.
Login in with `tsh` with a user that has this role or has a role with these allows.
```
kind: role
version: v4
metadata:
  name: plugin-admin
spec:
  allow:
    impersonate:
      roles:
      - access-plugin
      users:
      - access-plugin
    rules:
      - resources: ['roles']
        verbs: ['create','update','read','list','delete']
      - resources: ['user']
        verbs: ['create','update','read','list','delete']

```
  </TabItem>

</Tabs>


Create a non-interactive `access-plugin` user and role.

```yaml
kind: user
metadata:
  name: access-plugin
spec:
  roles: ['access-plugin']
version: v2
---
kind: role
version: v4
metadata:
  name: access-plugin
spec:
  allow:
    rules:
      - resources: ['access_request']
        verbs: ['list', 'read', 'update']
```

Here and below follow along and create yaml resources using `tctl create -f`:

```
$ tctl create -f access.yaml
```

<Admonition type="tip">
  If you're using other plugins, you might want to create different users and roles for different plugins
</Admonition>

#### Export access-plugin Certificate

Teleport Plugin use the `access-plugin` role and user to perform the approval. We export the identity file using [`tctl auth sign`](../../setup/reference/cli.mdx#tctl-auth-sign). You have the option of connecting through the proxy or auth server.  Teleport Cloud users must use the proxy server.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="OpenSource, Enterprise" scope={["oss","enterprise"]}>
```code
$ tctl auth sign --format=file --user=access-plugin --out=/var/lib/teleport/plugins/email/auth_id --ttl=2190h
# ...
```

The above sequence should result in an identity file `./plugin-access-identity` with signed SSH and TLS certs for authenticating auth requests. We'll reference `./plugin-access-identity` later when [configuring the plugins](#configuring-teleport-email).



<Admonition
  type="note"
  title="Certificate Lifetime"
>
  By default, [`tctl auth sign`](../../setup/reference/cli.mdx#tctl-auth-sign) produces certificates with a relatively short lifetime. For production deployments, the `--ttl` flag can be used to ensure a more practical certificate lifetime. `--ttl=8760h` exports a 1 year token
</Admonition>

## Installing the Teleport Email Plugin

We recommend installing the Teleport Plugins alongside the Teleport Proxy. This is an ideal
location as plugins have a low memory footprint, and will require both public internet access
and Teleport Auth access.  We currently only provide linux-amd64 binaries, you can also
compile these plugins from [source](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport-plugins/tree/master/access/email).

**Install the plugin**

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Download">
  ```code
  $ curl -L https://get.gravitational.com/teleport-access-email-v(=teleport.version=)-linux-amd64-bin.tar.gz
  $ tar -xzf teleport-access-email-v(=teleport.version=)-linux-amd64-bin.tar.gz
  $ cd teleport-access-email
  $ ./install
  ```
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="From Source">
  To install from source you need `git` and `go >= (=teleport.golang=)` installed.

  ```code
  # Checkout teleport-plugins
  $ git clone https://github.com/gravitational/teleport-plugins.git
  $ cd teleport-plugins/access/email
  $ make
  ```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>


Run `./install` in from `teleport-email` or place the executable in the appropriate `/usr/bin` or `/usr/local/bin` on the server installation.

### Configuring Teleport Email

Teleport Email uses a config file in TOML format. Generate a boilerplate config by
running the following command:

```code
$ teleport-email configure > teleport-email.toml
$ sudo mv teleport-email.toml /etc
```

Then, edit the config as needed.

```conf
# /etc/teleport-email.toml
[teleport]
addr = "example.com:3025"                               # Teleport Auth/Proxy/Tunnel Server Address

# Identity file exported with tctl auth sign --format file
identity = "/var/lib/teleport/plugins/email/auth_id"    # Identity file

[mailgun]
domain = "sandboxbd81caddef744a69be0e5b544ab0c3bd.mailgun.org" # Mailgun domain name
private_key = "xoxb-11xx"                                      # Mailgun private key

# As an alternative, you can use SMTP server credentials:
#
# [smtp]
# host = "smtp.gmail.com"
# port = 587
# username = "username@gmail.com"
# password = ""
# password_file = "/var/lib/teleport/plugins/email/smtp_password"

[users]
sender = "noreply@example.com"   # From: email address
recipients = ["all@example.com"] # These recipients will receive all review requests

[log]
output = "stderr" # Logger output. Could be "stdout", "stderr" or "/var/lib/teleport/email.log"
severity = "INFO" # Logger severity. Could be "INFO", "ERROR", "DEBUG" or "WARN".
```

#### Editing the config file

In the Teleport section, use the certificates you've generated with `tctl auth sign` before. The plugin installer creates a folder for those certificates in `/var/lib/teleport/plugins/email/` — so just move the certificates there and make sure the config points to them.

In mailgun or smtp section set the credentials.  Set the delivery recipients.  Teleport will also use the reviewers if set in the request.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="OpenSource, Enterprise" scope={["oss","enterprise"]}>
```conf
# /etc/teleport-email.toml
[teleport]
auth_server = "example.com:3025"                               # Teleport Auth/Proxy/Tunnel Server Address

[mailgun]
domain = "sandboxbd81caddef744a69be0e5b544ab0c3bd.mailgun.org" # Mailgun domain name
private_key = "xoxb-11xx"                                      # Mailgun private key

# As an alternative, you can use SMTP server credentials:
#
# [smtp]
# host = "smtp.gmail.com"
# port = 587
# username = "username@gmail.com"
# password = ""
# password_file = "/var/lib/teleport/plugins/email/smtp_password"

[users]
sender = "noreply@example.com"   # From: email address
[delivery]
recipients = ["all@example.com"] # These recipients will receive all review requests

[log]
output = "stderr" # Logger output. Could be "stdout", "stderr" or "/var/lib/teleport/email.log"
severity = "INFO" # Logger severity. Could be "INFO", "ERROR", "DEBUG" or "WARN".
```
</TabItem>

  <TabItem label="Cloud" scope={["cloud"]}>

```conf
# /etc/teleport-email.toml
[teleport]

# Identity file exported with tctl auth sign --format file
identity = "/var/lib/teleport/plugins/email/auth_id"    # Identity file

[mailgun]
domain = "sandboxbd81caddef744a69be0e5b544ab0c3bd.mailgun.org" # Mailgun domain name
private_key = "xoxb-11xx"                                      # Mailgun private key

# As an alternative, you can use SMTP server credentials:
#
# [smtp]
# host = "smtp.gmail.com"
# port = 587
# username = "username@gmail.com"
# password = ""
# password_file = "/var/lib/teleport/plugins/email/smtp_password"

[users]
sender = "noreply@example.com"   # From: email address
[delivery]
recipients = ["all@example.com"] # These recipients will receive all review requests

[log]
output = "stderr" # Logger output. Could be "stdout", "stderr" or "/var/lib/teleport/email.log"
severity = "INFO" # Logger severity. Could be "INFO", "ERROR", "DEBUG" or "WARN".
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Test Run

Assuming that Teleport is running, the email credentials are correct, the plugin config,
and provided all the certificates — you can now run the plugin and test the notifications.

```code
$ teleport-email start
```

If everything works fine, the log output should look like this:

```code
$ teleport-email start
INFO   Starting Teleport Access Email Plugin (): email/app.go:80
INFO   Plugin is ready email/app.go:101
```

### Testing the email notification

You can create a test permissions request with `tctl` and check if the plugin works as expected like this:

#### Create a test permissions request behalf of a user

```code
# Replace USERNAME with a Teleport local user, and TARGET_ROLE with a Teleport Role
$ tctl request create USERNAME --roles=TARGET_ROLE
```

A user can also try using `--request-roles` flag.

```code
# Example with a user trying to request a role DBA.
$ tsh login --request-roles=dba
```

#### Email notifications

The messages should automatically get sent to receipents in the recipients list.

```code
$ tctl request ls
```

### TSH User Login and Request Role

You can also test the full workflow from the user's perspective using `tsh`:

```code
# tsh login --request-roles=REQUESTED_ROLE
Seeking request approval... (id: 8f77d2d1-2bbf-4031-a300-58926237a807)
```

The messages should automatically get sent to receipents in the recipients list.

### Setup with SystemD

In production, we recommend starting teleport plugin daemon via an init system like systemd .
Here's the recommended Teleport Plugin service unit file for systemd:

```ini
(!examples/systemd/plugins/teleport-email.service!)
```

Save this as `teleport-email.service`.
